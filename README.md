# Major-project
Youtube trending video analytics

Jupyter Notebook: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Major%20proj.ipynb

This is my Final Major Project, where I analyze YouTube trending videos to uncover insights into viewership patterns, engagement ratios, category performance, and geographic trends.

The project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline using:

SQL for query-based validation,

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for exploratory data analysis and visualization,

Power BI for building a 2-page interactive dashboard, and

A final PDF report documenting the process and findings.
